#### 2. [maximum reverse sum of sequence](./code/maximum_reverse_sum_of_sequence.cpp)
```
Describe: Given a series of numbers, we can reverse the suffix, prefix or both. 
Get the maximum subarray sum of the numbers.

Note: reverse must beginning at the first one or the last one.
such as: 2 2 3 4 -2 -3 can transform to: -2 -2 3 4 -2 3

#### 3. [distinct subsequences](./code/distinct_subsequences.cpp)
```
Describe: Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct 
subsequences of T in S.

Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the 
original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without 
disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a 
subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

#### 4. [minimal shift](./code/minimal_shift.cpp)
```
Describe: Give a string 'str', shift the last k element to the first can make 
the shifted string equals the origin one. Calculate the minimal k.

#### 5. [edit distance](./code/edit_distance.cpp)
```
Given two string str1, str2, calculate the distance between str1
and str2. The distance increase by one when do either operation of the
Insert, Delete, Replace.
